Saifedean Ammous

### Sumary

In "The Bitcoin Standard", economist Saifedean Ammous walks the reader through the fascinating history of money technologies and explores how they acquired a monetary role and how they lost it. The lessons in this story show what are the desirable characteristics of money and how Bitcoin is the best embodiment of the characteristics. Ammous also sheds light on the economic, social, cultural and political benefits of a strong currency over a weak currency and explains in great detail the potential role that Bitcoin can generate in a digital economy.

Bitcoin is, in reality, a decentralized alternative to national banks, chosen by the free market, politically neutral and decentralized, and not a cheap payment network or a preferred currency of criminals. The book shows how this alternative brings enormous complications to individual freedom and prosperity. For anyone looking for an understanding of this new digital money, The Bitcoin Standard is the essential resource.
