## The Bitcoin Standard: The Decentralized Alternative to Central Banking

### Author

Saifedean Ammous

### Summary

In "The Bitcoin Standard", economist Saifedean Ammous walks the reader through the fascinating history of money technologies and explores how they acquired a monetary role and how they lost it. The lessons in this story show what are the desirable characteristics of money and how Bitcoin is the best embodiment of the characteristics. Ammous also sheds light on the economic, social, cultural and political benefits of a strong currency over a weak currency and explains in great detail the potential role that Bitcoin can generate in a digital economy.

Bitcoin is, in reality, a decentralized alternative to national banks, chosen by the free market, politically neutral and decentralized, and not a cheap payment network or a preferred currency of criminals. The book shows how this alternative brings enormous complications to individual freedom and prosperity. For anyone looking for an understanding of this new digital money, The Bitcoin Standard is the essential resource.

## 21 Lessons: What I've Learned from Falling Down the Bitcoin Rabbit Hole

### Author

Gigi

### Summary

In "21 Lessons", the author tells what he learned from Bitcoin from philosophical, economic and technological perspectives:

"Falling down the Bitcoin rabbit hole is a strange experience. Like many others, I feel like I have learned more in the last couple of years studying Bitcoin than I have during two decades of formal education. The following lessons are a distillation of what I’ve learned. First published as an article series titled “What I’ve Learned From Bitcoin,” what follows can be seen as a third edition of the original series. Like Bitcoin, these lessons aren’t a static thing. I plan to work on them periodically, releasing updated versions and additional material in the future.Bitcoin is an inexhaustible teacher, which is why I do not claim that these lessons are all-encompassing or complete. They are a reflection of my personal journey down the rabbit hole. There are many more lessons to be learned, and every person will learn something different from entering the world of Bitcoin. I hope that you will find these lessons useful and that the process of learning them by reading won’t be as arduous and painful as learning them firsthand."

## The Internet Of Money (volume one)

### Author

Andreas M. Antonopoulos

### Summary

While many books explain the how of bitcoin, The Internet of Money delves into the why of bitcoin. Acclaimed information-security expert and author of Mastering Bitcoin, Andreas M. Antonopoulos examines and contextualizes the significance of bitcoin through a series of essays spanning the exhilarating maturation of this technology.

Bitcoin, a technological breakthrough quietly introduced to the world in 2008, is transforming much more than finance. Bitcoin is disrupting antiquated industries to bring financial independence to billions worldwide. In this book, Andreas explains why bitcoin is a financial and technological evolution with potential far exceeding the label "digital currency."

Andreas goes beyond exploring the technical functioning of the bitcoin network by illuminating bitcoin's philosophical, social, and historical implications. As the Internet has essentially transformed how people around the world interact and has permanently impacted our lives in ways we never could have imagined, bitcoin - the Internet of money - is fundamentally changing our approach to solving social, political, and economic problems through decentralized technology.
